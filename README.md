This project was bootstrapped with [Create React Native App](https://github.com/react-community/create-react-native-app).
This application uses react native and Expo to create a soundboard that can play all of the hilarious "Oh Yeah?" moments from the movie Fargo.

See [this clip](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r5Tnc0JAhXQ) for reference.
